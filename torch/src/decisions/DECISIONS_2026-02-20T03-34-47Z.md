# Decisions — scheduler-update-agent — 2026-02-20

## Decision: No roster changes applied

**Reason**: All roster files are already fully in sync with prompt files on disk.
Both `roster.json` arrays and both scheduler markdown tables are correct.

## Decision: TORCH paths resolved to torch/ prefix

**Reason**: TORCH was installed into `torch/` subdirectory. All references to
`src/prompts/` in the TORCH prompt files resolve to `torch/src/prompts/` relative
to the repo root. Artifact paths resolved accordingly.

## Decision: Alphabetical order verified as ASCII/byte order

**Reason**: `roster.json` uses ASCII byte-order for sorting (`pr-review-agent` before
`prompt-*` since '-' < 'o' in ASCII). This matches the current roster.json ordering
and is treated as the canonical sort order for this project.
